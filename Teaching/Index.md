**Notes:**

The early church did not look like what we know today.  The church can take
on many different appearances.  The church is a fire that God starts but
can not be contained.

We are burning with that same fire. That can spread to impact the entire
world around us. We are the body of Christ and are discovering together
what God is doing with us.

Acts is a book filled with miracles and a people that were empowered to
take the good news to the world.

During the forty days after Jesus suffered and died, he appeared to the apostles 
from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. 
And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.

Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, “Do not leave 
Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told 
you before. John baptized with water, but in just a few days you 
will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
The Ascension of Jesus

So when the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, “Lord, 
has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”

He replied, “The Father alone has the authority to set those dates 
and times, and they are not for you to know. 8 But you will receive 
power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my 
witnesses, telling people about me everywhere — in Jerusalem, 
throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”  -- Act 1:3-8

Everything changes when God shows up in power.

**Discussion Questions:**

* When have you personally experienced the power and presence of the Holy Spirit?
* How has that changed your life?

**Notes:**

To know who we are we must first know who the creator is.

O Lord, you are righteous, and your regulations are fair.  Your laws are 
perfect and completely trustworthy. I am overwhelmed with indignation, 
for my enemies have disregarded your words. Your promises have been 
thoroughly tested; that is why I love them so much. -- Psalms 119:137-140 NLT
    
What shapes us is not our desires but God's desires for us.

Many of us make decisions based on what brings us pleasure. We pursue what we
want, then we make sure that we are not violating any biblical command. We
want to not what God will tolerate rather than what brings him pleasure.

I pray with all my heart; answer me, Lord! I will obey your decrees. 
I cry out to you; rescue me, that I may obey your laws. -- Psalms 119:145-146 NLT

What does it mean to follow Christ.

* We admit that we have sinned.
* Repent and turn to God

Today when you hear his voice,  don’t harden your hearts.
For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest 
two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. 
It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. Nothing in all creation is 
hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he 
is the one to whom we are accountable.
-- Hebrews 4:7, 12

Maybe you are ready to experience the nearness of God.

**Discussion Questions:**

* What role does repentance play in learning about righteousness?
* How are we transformed into the Image of Christ?


### Week 3 - Act 2 - Pentecost - May 31, 2020

**Notes:**

The church needs to bring reassurance of God's presence and purpose not reasons why things are happening.

During the forty days after his crucifixion, Jesus appeared to the apostles from time to time, 
and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the 
Kingdom of God.

Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, “Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father 
sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before. John baptized with water, but in just a 
few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

On the day of Pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place. Suddenly, there 
was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where 
they were sitting. Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on 
each of them. And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other 
languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.

Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day—about 3,000 
in all.
All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship, and to 
sharing in meals (including the Lord’s Supper), and to prayer.  A deep sense of awe came 
over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. And all the 
believers met together in one place and shared everything they had.

They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They 
worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared 
their meals with great joy and generosity— all the while praising God and enjoying the 
goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.
 
 -- Acts 2

**Discussion Questions:**

* How is God using you bring reassurance to others?
* Who are you listening to that is speaking of God's reconciliation?
* What is blocking this experience in your life?


### Week 4 - Act 5 - Hypocrisy - June 7, 2020

**Scriptures**

All the believers were united in heart and mind. And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything they had. The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s great blessing was upon them all. There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell them and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need.

For instance, there was Joseph, the one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas (which means “Son of Encouragement”). He was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus. He sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles. 

But there was a certain man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property. He brought part of the money to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. With his wife’s consent, he kept the rest.

Then Peter said, “Ananias, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself. The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, the money was also yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren’t lying to us but to God!”

As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified. Then some young men got up, wrapped him in a sheet, and took him out and buried him.

About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, “Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?”

“Yes,” she replied, “that was the price.”

And Peter said, “How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door, and they will carry you out, too.”

Instantly, she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened.

-- Act 4-5


**Notes:**

The church is a place where all people can find healing and a true connection with the living God.
But the church is also made up of people and we are deeply flawed.
At some point every believer will be greatly hurt by people in the church.
This is the result of the sin that we hold onto.

Every follower of Jesus wishes to be seen as completely holy, but our actions and thinking are often are at odds 
with the gospel. This hypocrisy causes us to act different that what we say we believe.  
It will poison our relationship with God and others.

We must have others in our lives that speak God's truth to us.  Without that influence we are doomed to
lie to ourselves and others about our true nature.  This ultimately is a attempt to lie to God and resist
his influence over us.

Hypocrisy can only be broken when we can hear truth from another person.  This is a vital part of following
Christ.  You will not survive with it.


**Discussion Questions:**

* What area of your life do you need to share with someone who cares about you?
* Who do you have in your life that speaks true in such a way that you are open to what they say?
* How has the influence of others made you grow in your relationship to God?
