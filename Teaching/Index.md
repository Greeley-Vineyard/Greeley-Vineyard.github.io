## Acts Sermon Series

As we walk through the book of Acts we will learn about what life was like in the
early church.  The lives of the first disciples were filled with turmoil and conflict 
from outside and inside the church.

Yet through it all God shaped a group of people that would change the world. Perhaps
God is doing something similar in our day.  Let's explore the life of the early
church and learn about how we can cope with the confusion of our time.
